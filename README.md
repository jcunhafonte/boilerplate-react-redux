## Introduction

Briefly, to develop this project I used the following technologies:

- REACT
- REDUX
- SASS
- BABEL
- WEBPACK
- ESLINT
- REDUX DEVTOOLS

The structure I've implemented was the one I've considered the most correct for this project. There are certainly other alternatives to make it but, like I've already said, working with REDUX has been a challenge and I think there is no problem with this structure.

As you can check in my package I haven't used any other dependency except REACT or REDUX, in order to ensure the best perfomance of the project.
The use of SASS and other compilation tools of WEBPACK was also used to serve the same purpose, that is ensuring the best performance of the project.

## Installation

To test the development files, it's necessary to follow these steps:

Copy the files
```bash
$ git clone https://jcunhafonte@bitbucket.org/jcunhafonte/strv-test-project.git
```

Install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

Run the development server
```bash
$ npm start
```

Create the production build
```bash
$ npm run clean && npm run build:webpack
```
